## Atributions: 
Because of the necessity to remove paid or in other way protected assets from appearing in repo or history, the public mirror has squashed history which means there is no obvious proof of contribution from someone else which is not fair so at least in this way I want to mention [Adam Světlík](https://github.com/AdamSvetlik) that helped with parts of this project. If interested in specific contributions because of for example job application, you can contact me at [contact-me@mark-walker.net](mailto:contact-me@mark-walker.net), and I will provide detailed list of feature contributions and general experience of working with Adam.
